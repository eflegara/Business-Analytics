# Business Analytics
This will be a repository of notebooks I am sharing to my non-data science students. In particular, I teach Business Analytics to MBA and Executive MBA students

## Getting Started

If you do not have Python yet installed on your computer, you need to install it if you want to be able to run the notebooks shared in this repository. 

### Installing Python

The easiest way for non-programmers to install Python on their own computers is through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). The link will take you to the Anaconda webpage where you can download the installer depending on your OS (Windows, MacOS, or Linux).
